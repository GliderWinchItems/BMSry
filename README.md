Battery Management System Relay based design

Battery cell measurement and balancing design based on flying capacitors for voltage measurement and FET flip-flops for balancing. SPI communication and a common ADC external to the boards for measurement. 

Two approaches for 18 cell module. One packs the parts onto one 160x100mm two sided board. The other splits the cells into groups of eight for one pcb, and three pcbs are interconnected, along with selection jumpers, to accommodate the 18 cells. 

(12/16/2020) Design is in preliminary form and probably has some "glitches."
